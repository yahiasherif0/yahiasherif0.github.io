# Why I wrote this?

After struggling for four consecutive days to set it up, I encountered numerous errors and realized that I was not the only one facing such problems. Therefore, I decided to write an article to help anyone who wants to run an Android ARM machine, so they don't waste their time trying to figure out the correct way.

# How to setup?

First we need to turn on hyper-V

If you don't have hyper-v you need to install this (also of this tutorial didn't work with you you need to install it)

```
https://github.com/google/android-emulator-hypervisor-driver/releases
```
Next we need to navigate to

```
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37505709/how-do-i-download-the-android-sdk-without-downloading-android-studio/51429326#51429326
```
and download **SDK Installer_r24.4.1**

# Which android version to install?

First open **SDK Manager**

I tried many versions of ARM android images and the only version worked is **7.1.1 API 25**

You need to install these also

The intel HAXM is required to run this avd HAXM is not installed error message can be solved by installing **intel x86 emulator accelerator**:

install this also
```
https://github.com/intel/haxm
```

Now open **AVD Manager**

In my case if I choosed a device rather than **Nexus 4** or **WXGA Tablet** the vm won't work. (I really don't know why)

Also make the internal storage 200 - 500 mb if the machine didn't open

And check **use host gpu** option

Now let's start the machine
